It can be a bit tricky to get it all work together - so here's list quickly put together.

#How to (for Windows 10)

1. Install 32b JDK (latest 1.8 worked for me)
2. Install Starcraft
3. Update Starcraft to latest (1.6) version
4. Install BWAPI_410B_2_Setup.exe (not latest), set admin rights to chaoslauncher
5. Download BWMIRROR_v2.4

6. Import in IntelliJ, run
7. In ChaosLauncher - tick BWAPI Injector(RELEASE) (and possibly W-MODE)
8. Potentially configure your chaos cfg (to autostart games etc...)
9. Start starcraft via launcher

_IntelliJ files intentionally pushed!_

TODO: 
- check how much of IntelliJ we actually need
- update gitignore to ignore extracted dlls
